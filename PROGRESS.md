  - python-dotenv

- Created configuration utilities:
  - Environment variable loading with python-dotenv
  - Database connection configuration
  - Application settings

- Set up Streamlit configuration with `.streamlit/config.toml`

## Task 2: Implement database models and connection ✓

- Created SQLModel classes for database schema:
  - `Cell`: Representing a battery cell with chemistry and form factor
  - `Machine`: Representing a testing machine
  - `Experiment`: Representing a battery test experiment
  - `Step`: Representing a test step within an experiment
  - `Measurement`: Representing detailed measurements within a step
  - `ProcessedFile`: Tracking processed files to prevent duplicates
  - `SavedView`: Storing dashboard configurations

- Implemented database connection functionality:
  - Connection setup and management
  - Session handling
  - Database initialization
  - Connection testing

- Created database utility functions:
  - `init_db()`: Initialize database and create tables
  - `get_session()`: Get a new database session
  - `test_db_connection()`: Test database connectivity
  - `create_db_and_tables()`: Create all tables defined in models

- Implemented database migration framework using Alembic:
  - Created initial migration scripts
  - Added name field to Cell model in subsequent migration

## Task 3: Develop CSV parsing and extraction logic ✓

- Created extraction.py module with functions for processing ChromaLex CSV files:
  - `validate_csv_format()`: Verify that the CSV files have required headers
  - `map_step_types()`: Standardize step types (charge, discharge, rest)
  - `calculate_file_hash()`: Generate file hash for tracking processed files
  - `parse_step_csv()`: Process Step.csv file with specific header format
  - `parse_detail_csv()`: Process Detail.csv file with specific header format
  - `load_and_preprocess_files()`: Load and preprocess both CSV files
  - `convert_numpy_types()`: Convert numpy data types to Python native types

- Created example CSV files for testing:
  - Step.csv and Detail.csv files from various battery tests
  - Bad_Headers.csv for testing validations

## Task 4: Implement data transformation logic ✓

- Created transformation.py module with functions for processing battery data:
  - `calculate_c_rate()`: Calculate C-rate based on current and nominal capacity
  - `calculate_soc()`: Calculate State of Charge using Coulomb counting method
  - `extract_ocv_values()`: Extract Open Circuit Voltage values from rest steps
  - `transform_data()`: Apply all transformation functions to the step and detail data

- Implemented the SOC calculation algorithm using Coulomb counting:
  - Using specified reference discharge step for 0% SOC
  - Calculating SOC for all steps based on capacity values
  - Handling SOC propagation between charge/discharge cycles

## Task 5: Create data validation and preview functions ✓

- Implemented data validation functions:
  - `detect_voltage_anomalies()`: Identify unusual voltage patterns
  - `detect_capacity_anomalies()`: Find outliers in capacity measurements
  - `detect_temperature_anomalies()`: Identify unusual temperature patterns
  - `validate_soc_range()`: Check SOC values are within expected range
  - `validate_c_rate()`: Verify C-rate values are positive and within range
  - `validate_data_continuity()`: Check for gaps in timestamps
  - `validate_value_jumps()`: Identify sudden jumps in measurement values

- Implemented validation report generation:
  - `generate_validation_report()`: Compile validation results into a report
  - `generate_summary_table()`: Create summary statistics for selected steps

## Task 6: Implement upload and metadata UI (In Progress)

- Created upload.py with components for file upload and metadata entry
- Implemented preview.py for data preview before processing
- Added settings.py for application configuration

## Task 7: Develop step selection and processing UI (In Progress)

- Implemented step_selection.py for selecting reference discharge step and analysis steps
- Added processing controls for data transformation

## Task 8: Implement visualization and dashboard UI (In Progress)

- Created initial battery_plots.py module for visualization
- Set up dashboard.py for the main analytics interface
- Implemented utility functions in visualization/utils.py

## Task 9: Implement database loading and retrieval (In Progress)

- Created database models for storing processed data
- Implemented initial database operations for experiment metadata

## Task 10: Integrate components and create main application (In Progress)

- Set up streamlit_app.py as the main entry point
- Created basic application navigation
- Implemented workflow configuration for Streamlit

## Next Steps

1. Complete the dashboard UI implementation with interactive visualizations
2. Enhance data visualization with all planned plot types
3. Finalize database integration with efficient query patterns
4. Implement saved views functionality for dashboard configurations
5. Add comprehensive error handling and user feedback
6. Create user documentation and usage examples
